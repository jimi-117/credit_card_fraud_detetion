# credit_card_fraud_detetion
This is my first fraud detection project.
I use Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.
It might have 2 notebooks minimum:
    - A notebook to EDA and cleaning, may construction ML model
    - A notebook to evaluation with classification metrics, by using test dataset.

Note: To train model, I have to use ONLY normal data. So first step I have to do is to prepare fraud data and same size normal data. And combine them to create Test dataset which has 50% normal data and 50% fraud data.

The csv is disponible in Kaggle datasets below:
